In this Project i created a bank app using Java and MySQL.

With Java, i created the UI, the depending functionalities of the app such as transactions, login and register functions,
as well as establishing an connection to the Database.

For the Database i created a small database made with MySQL and SQLWorkBench.

The App functions by running any file from given directory, a ui opens up with login fields.
The user also has the option of registering. 

Username and password have a set of rules where for the username the app checks if the name is available or not
and for the password to be at least 8 characters long including numbers and symbols.

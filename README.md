In Order to run the App following things must be commited:

First install MySQL Connector/J latest version platform independent as ZIP file + SQL Workbench and set them up in your coding environment.

create a new Database with name and password, make sure to remebmber your credentials.

For this project, i created a database with the same name as the project.

after creating one, copy the URL of the database and insert it into this code section:


![SQL Connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3a6570-c29b-447d-95a4-226b130dd8a8)

Make sure that everything is correct otherwise you will run into some errors.

Once you set everything up, insert this SQL command in your database:


![SQL Command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f96f6f39-7784-45c6-aeba-8f49d106591a)


After you have done that and having the project code files in your coding environment, you can run any file from the project and the

App should show up in a small window.
